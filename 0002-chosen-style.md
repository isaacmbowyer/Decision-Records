# Choosing Layered Archiecture for C# REST API and NEXT.JS Frontend

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
Determining the appropriate archiectural design approach for both the backend (C#) and the frontend (NEXT.JS), proved to be a difficult decision. The goal was to ensure that the code was maintainable, scalable and used seperation of concerns throughout the application. 

## Considered Options
- _Layered Architecture_: Seperating the application into distinct layers (presentation, business and data access)
- _Component Architecture_: System stuctured into self-contained modular units called compoments and each one encapsulates a set of functionaltities.
- _Microservices Architecture_: Decomposed the system into small, independent deployable services.

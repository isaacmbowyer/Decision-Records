# Applying Seperation of Concerns in Frontend and Backend

## Status 
- Accepted
  
## Context and Problem Statement 
Since the project is complex, maintaining a scalable and modular codebase becomes important. It is cruical that the code does not become tightly coupled in both the frontend and backend as it would lead to challenges in code readability, maintainability and testing. To address these issues the need to adop a design pattern was crucial.  

## Considered Options
- _Seperation of Concerns_: Structures the codebase in a way that lets each module be responsible for a specific task.
- _Factory Method_: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.

## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option:_ Implement Seperation of Concerns pattern in both the frontend and backend codebase. 

## Consequences

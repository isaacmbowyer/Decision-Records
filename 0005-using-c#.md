# Choosing C# for REST API (Backend)

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
When chosing a technology stack for the backend REST API, the goal was to choose a programming lanaguage that aligned with my requirments and provided features and support for building RESTful services. 

## Considered Options
- _C#_: Statically-typed programming language developed by Microsoft. Widely used for building scalable web applications
- _Django_: High level Python web framework that encourages rapid development with clean design. 
- _Node.js_: A JS runtime environment that is event-driven, primarly used for creating server-side applications.
- 
## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option_: Selected "C#" as the programming language for the backend REST API. This decision was primarly based upon my expetise in C# from my first two years of university. By taking advantage of my existing knowledge, it will significantly reduce the learning curve and make coding the API more easier. Futhermore, C# excels in Object-Oriented Proramming (OOP) and has an organised approach for building complex systems. This would align with my goal of maintaining clean code that is simple and maintainable.

## Consequences
Choosing C# for the backend introduced a set of consequences. While the language excelled in utilizing the .NET ecosystem, it is incredibly extensive and was difficult to understand what resource was needed and where.

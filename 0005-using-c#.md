# Choosing C# for REST API (Backend)

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
When chosing a technology stack for the backend REST API, the goal was to choose a programming lanaguage that aligned with my requirments and provided features and support for building RESTful services. 

## Considered Options
- _C#_: Statically-typed programming language developed by Microsoft. Widely used for building scalable web applications
- _Django_: High level Python web framework that encourages rapid development with clean design. 
- _Node.js_: A JS runtime environment that is event-driven, primarly used for creating server-side applications.

## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option_: Selected "C#" as the programming language for the backend REST API. This decision was primarly based upon my expertise in C# from my first two years of university. By taking advantage of my existing knowledge, it will significantly reduce the learning curve and make coding the API more easier. Futhermore, C# excels in Object-Oriented Proramming (OOP) and has an organised approach for building complex systems. This would align with my goal of creating code that is clean, simple and maintainable.

## Consequences
While choosing the C# framework introduced many advantages, it did leverage challenges. One which was the extensive amount of libaries leveraged from the Microsoft Ecosystem, as navigating through the large amount of resources made it difficult to understand which library was suitable when it came to planning archiectural patterns.

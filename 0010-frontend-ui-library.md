# Choosing Chakra UI for Frontend Styling

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
Selecting an appropriate styling framework for the website is crucial to achieving a user interface that is appealing and has a responsive design. It was important to use a framework that would speed up development process while aligning with the project's design.

## Considered Options
- _Chakra UI_: A customizable React component library for building user interfaces.
- _Bootstrap_: A popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components and styles for responsive websites.
- _Tailwind CSS_: Provides low-level classes that can be combined to build custom designs within the HTML. 

## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option_: A clear choice for styling was "Chakra UI" library. It's integration with React components would simplify and speed coding development as not only would it mean less code but it would also ensure consistent styling and syntax is used at all times.

## Consequences
Chakra UI stood out for its exceptional consistency, as it offers a collection of modular components that would ensure a uniformed design across the whole website. This would simplify the creation of interactive user interfaces as majority of the work is already done for me. The framework is extremely popular and has had 2 million downloads per month, this means that it has a widespread adoption in the development community with extensive resources. This means that whenever a problem occurs, finding a solution or a tutorial wouldn't be a problem.

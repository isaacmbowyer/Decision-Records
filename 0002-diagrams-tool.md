# Using Draw.io for Design Diagrams 

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
Choosing the right tool for conveying the design, behaviour and structure of the architecture was crucial for ensuring clear and simple communication for how the system would react to components. An interface that supports for various diagram types were essential in order to prevent multiple tools being used.

## Considered Options
-  _Draw.io_: A web-based diagramming tool that allows for the creation of various types of diagrams, including C4, ERDs, Sequence and Class diagrams. 
- _Plant UML_: A coding based approach to creating diagrams using human-readable syntax. 

## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option_: "Draw.io" was the preferred tool for creating design diagrams. It has a user-friendly interface and offers flexibility in creating visually appealing diagrams to effectively communicate the design behavioural concepts.

## Consequences
Draw.io's interface made it easy for me to create and edit diagrams whenever needed as access to the resources was always available. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of the visa system, the documentational components were understood a lot better with visualization.

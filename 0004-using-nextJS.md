# Choosing NEXT.JS for Frontend

## Status 
- Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement 
Upon the process of selecting a frontend framework for the application, the need to evaluate options for a frontend framework arose. The goal was to identify a framework that aligns with the project requriments and supports modern web development pratices. 

## Considered Options
- _NEXT.JS_: React framework that provides additional features for server-side rendering
- _Angular_: Type-Script based, single-page compoment-based frameowrk for building scalable web applications
- _Vue_: Model-View frontend JS libary for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

## Decision Outcome 
_Chosen Option_: Using NEXT.JS for frontend development as it is built on top of React, allowing for intergration with React components and libraries. This is a main advantage as React is leading in the best frontend frameworks so external tools are likely to be up-to-date and well maintained. Futhemore, NEXT.JS supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) out of the box. This is useful for optimizing performance and user experience as there won't be any delays for deployment as it is automatically done for you.

## Consequences
The decision to use NEX.JS for frontend development resulted in positive consequences. Understanding the architecture proved to be straightforward, which helped in planning which relevant libraries that would be needed (Chakra UI, Axios, UseQuery) for the system.
